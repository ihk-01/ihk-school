	<h1>Hi! I'm Ingrid</h1>
	<h3>A fun fact about me!</h3>

	<p>It started out innocently enough. I was looking for a way to stay fit and wanted to try something new, so when a friend of mine invited me to come to an open house at her martial arts studio, I gladly accepted. That's where I was introduced to Krav Maga. Not only did I enjoy participating in this new sport, it got me in the best shape of my life, gave me a close, new circle of friends, and taught me how to defend myself. Four years later, I earned my blackbelt. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made.</p>
